              Hi! I am Irene, a Spanish multimedia engineering graduate with
              more than 3 years of work experience as a Software Engineer.
              Recently moved to Shinjuku, Iâ€™m looking for new opportunitiesin
              Tokyo!
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion lies in the impact of digital media on our daily lives
              and the diverse creative ways in which people can interact with
              them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from programming, in my free time I enjoy playing video
              games curled up with my cat, fiber arts and learning about fashion
              history.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have mainly worked with Java and Angular using Typescript,
              building the UX of aeronautical applications. However, I am always
              looking forward to acquiring new skills, currently looking forward
              to expand my Frontend tech stack.
            </p>

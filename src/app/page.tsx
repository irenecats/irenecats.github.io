        <p>
          Hi! I am Irene, a Spanish multimedia engineering graduate with more
          than 3 years of work experience as a Software Engineer. Recently moved
          to Shinjuku, Iâ€™m looking for new opportunitiesin Tokyo!
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion lies in the impact of digital media on our daily lives and
          the diverse creative ways in which people can interact with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from programming, in my free time I enjoy playing video games
          curled up with my cat, fiber arts and learning about fashion history.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have mainly worked with Java and Angular using Typescript, building
          the UX of aeronautical applications. However, I am always looking
          forward to acquiring new skills, currently looking forward to expand
          my Frontend tech stack.
